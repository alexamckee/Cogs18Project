    "I created a chatbot that could be implemented at my job on campus at the Registrar's Office. The office deals with many programs and because of that at the front desk I spend most of my time directing people to who they need to speak with. The chatbot automates this process based on the area you need help with. There are nine options you can choose from and based on which one you choose it gives you follow up questions to direct you to person who needs to help you. "
